jack2pcm [-n <name>] [-b <size>] [-xqh] <port1> [<port2>]

   -n <name>        name for this JACK client (default jack2pcm-PID)
   -b <size>        set ringbuffer to this size in bytes per port (k or M
                    suffix accepted; default 1M)
   -x               swap byte order
 <port1> & <port2>  autoconnect JACK client to these port(s)

   -h               display this usage message and exit


Overview
--------

This utility is a simple JACK client that connects to one or more JACK ports
as specified on the command-line, converts the audio data read from those
port(s) to signed 16-bit PCM samples and writes it to standard output. When
more than one port is specified, the samples from the ports are interleaved
in the output. A ringbuffer is used internally to buffer the real-time JACK
callback from the sample conversion and output code; the size of this
ringbuffer may be specified on the command-line. If the -x option is
specifed, the most and least significant bytes in each 16-bit output sample
are swapped from the native host order.
